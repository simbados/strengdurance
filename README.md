The repository for the strengthdurance application

I am building an application that is capable of recording your strength and endurance workouts.

It will provide an easy interface with minimum interaction from the user side.
So that daily recordings are done in under 5 Minutes

If you like the idea and want to contribute, feel free to create PRs.
